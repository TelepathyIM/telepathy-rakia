.SH NAME
telepathy-sofiasip \- Telepathy connection manager for SIP
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@libexecdir@/telepathy\-sofiasip\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtelepathy\-sofiasip\fR implements the Telepathy D-Bus specification for
the Session Initiation Protocol, allowing Telepathy clients like
.BR empathy (1)
to connect to Voice over IP providers that implement SIP.
.PP
It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and should usually be
started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful to
start it manually for debugging.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no command-line options.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBTPSIP_DEBUG\fR=\fItype\fR
May be set to "all" for full debug output, or various undocumented options
(which may change from release to release) to filter the output.
.TP
\fBTPSIP_LOGFILE\fR=\fIfilename\fR
May be set to the name of a file to overwrite with log messages. The filename
may be prefixed with \fB+\fR to append messages to an existing file instead
of overwriting it.
.TP
\fBTPSIP_PERSIST\fR
May be set to any value to avoid telepathy-sofiasip's usual automatic exit
when there have been no connections for a few seconds.
.TP
\fBTPORT_LOG\fR
May be set to any value to print all parsed SIP messages at the transport
layer (this functionality is provided by the underlying Sofia-SIP library,
which also offers various more specialized debugging options).
