  will be willing to handle our Text channels (Alban)
- Link successfully with strict linkers (Ionut Biru)
- Compile and run tests successfully under Automake 1.13 (fd.o #49725, Simon)
- Output the error message if GLib, GObject, GIO, libdbus or dbus-glib
  is missing (fd.o #49725, Simon)

telepathy-rakia 0.7.4 (2012-05-08)
----------------------------------

The "Call Me Maybe" release.

New features:

- The StreamedMedia Channel type has been replaced by Call1

telepathy-rakia 0.7.3 (2011-10-27)
----------------------------------

The "one sip too many" release.

Bugfixes:

- Correct the bus service name.
- Clear pending send flag if its respective stream direction is disabled.

telepathy-rakia 0.7.2 (2011-09-06)
----------------------------------

The "Correcting People" release.

News and enhancements:

- The project is renamed to Telepathy-Rakia.
- Updated Channel.Interface.DTMF implementation to spec 0.21.3.
  * This means dialstrings!
- Improved and slightly optimized logging.
- Added Messages properties to immutable properties.

This release also includes fixes and enhancements done to the stable
telepathy-sofiasip releases up to version 0.6.8. 

telepathy-sofiasip 0.7.1 (2011-02-01)
-------------------------------------

The "cross country" release.

New features:

- Added 'message-token' and 'message-sent' headers to incoming messages,
  derived from SIP message headers (fd.o #32607).
  NOTE: some existing clients logging messages, notably the one released
  in Maemo 5, make unrealistically strict assumptions about the uniqueness of
  'message-token' values. These logging implementations may exhibit problems
  with handling collisions in token values if used with this or later versions
  of Telpathy-SofiaSIP. Such collisions are unlikely, but possible if a
  remote endpoint generating the SIP Call-ID headers does not use an algorithm
  compliant with the SIP specification to provide sufficient uniqueness.
- Authentication channels implemented as a simple password challenge. 

Other enhancements:

- Test suite pulled up to Gabble standards.
- Tests for basic StreamedMedia call cases (fd.o #32085)
- Changed the type of the size parameter to gssize in tpsip_unquote_string().

Dependencies:

- telepathy-glib >= 0.13.9

telepathy-sofiasip 0.7.0 (2010-11-23)
-------------------------------------

The "Fermentation Vat No. 78" release.

- Opening the new development series.
- Implemented o.fd.Tp.Ch.I.Messages (fd.o #29377).
- Implemented o.fd.Tp.Protocol (fd.o #30538).
- Uses TpDBusDaemon to export media streams (fd.o #31720).
- Depends on telepathy-glib 0.12.0 now.
- Improvements in session state and signalling.

Changes in release 0.6.8 (2011-06-14)
-------------------------------------

The "homage to World's Toughest Fixes" release.

- Refactored handling of local codec information to avoid excessive re-INVITEs
- Remove non-intersecting local codecs from any further SDP
  negotiations (fd.o #30434).

Changes in release 0.6.7 (2011-05-23)
-------------------------------------

The "boarding up" release.

- Verify the validity of TLS certificates presented by SIP connection peers.
  This change is disruptive: it relies on root CA certificates being available
  to sofia-sip in the default verification path ``~/.sip/auth`` or file
  ``~/.sip/auth/cafile.pem``, or sofia-sip changed to use OpenSSL library
  defaults for verification path (sf.net #3306245).
  The connection parameter "ignore-tls-errors" is added to disable
  verification.
- Choose keepalive timing to make the iphb heartbeat synchronize with the
  other applications. (fd.o #37354)
- Omission of parameter 'keepalive-interval' does not mean disabled keepalives.
  A default defined by sofia-sip is used instead.
- More client-friendly behavior for connection parameter 'discover-stun':
  if set to TRUE, overrides 'stun-server'; by default discovery is performed if
  'stun-server' is not set. (fd.o #34227)
- If the home domain is given as an IP address, don't try to perform
  SRV lookups on it.
- Requires sofia-sip >= 1.12.11.
- Requires iphb >= 0.61.31, if used.

Changes in release 0.6.6 (2011-02-01)
-------------------------------------

The "Multiple Personality Communications Disorder" release.

- Reject incoming calls from the same URI as the local user, rather than
  crashing apologetically (fd.o #33716).

Changes in release 0.6.5 (2011-01-29)
-------------------------------------

The "make buildable" release.

- Changed the type of the size parameter to gssize in tpsip_unquote_string(). 
- Bugs fixed:
  - fd.o #31720 - stop using tp_get_bus()

Changes in release 0.6.4 (2010-08-27)
-------------------------------------

The "stretched thin" release.

- Fix a thinko preventing proper declining of incoming calls with
  informative statuses like 603 Decline.

Changes in release 0.6.3 (2010-06-21)
-------------------------------------

  when 'immutable-streams' parameter is true (fd.o #26387).
- Implemented the Debug interface (fd.o #26388).
