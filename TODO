TODO / telepathy-sofiasip
===============================================================

Feature Roadmap 
---------------

- re-registration on network change detection
- re-offer media streams on network change detection (handover)

Critical todo items
-------------------

empty

Account settings
----------------

- ability to disable known difficult-to-implement features
    - early media with PRACK
- ability to disable use of outbound proxy

Connection management
---------------------

- implement Connection.AdvertiseCapabilities()

Call flows
----------

- consider implementation of 3pcc call flows as described in RFC 3725.

Media sessions
--------------

- implement delayed application of stream direction changes requested by
  the client in case when an answer to a remote offer is being processed
- if multiple network interfaces are present, the wrong IP address
  may be offered in a c= SDP media line.

Presence and messaging
-----------------------

- implement Connection.Interface.Presense.AddStatus()
- implement Connection.Interface.Presense.SetStatus()
- implement Connection.Interface.Presense.RemoveStatus()
- implement Connection.Interface.Presense.ClearStatus()
- implement Connection.Interface.Presense.GetStatuses()
- implement Connection.Interface.Presense.RequestContactInfo()
- implement Connection.Interface.Presense.SetLastActivityTime()
- (obsolete?) ConnectionInterfacePresence; RequestPresence:
    - Response to SUBSCRIBE initiated by nua_glib_subscribe() emits a signal
      subscribe-answered from nua_glib but there is no signal for
      telepathy-sofiasip client, i.e. client cannot be informed if subscribe was
      successful.

Test programs
-------------

- In progress: unit tests for basic functionality (creation and removal of
  conn.mgr etc objects, registration, calling to itself, etc)

Plugin interface
----------------

- mechanism to dynamically load handlers for new types of 
  channels, and/or new types of connections
