Building
--------

telepathy-sofiasip requires GNU make.

When building from the devel tree (you need automake-1.9 or up):

sh> ./autogen.sh --no-configure

And then continue with the normal:

sh> ./configure
sh> make

Running
-------

Set the "RAKIA_PERSIST" environment variable to prevent the connection
manager from exiting after all connections have been disconnected. This
option is only available if telepathy-sofiasip was configured with
the "--enable-debug" option, which is on by default.

Other useful environment variables:
* RAKIA_DEBUG -- enables debug tracing via g_log.
  The value "all" enables all categories; for detailed categories look into
  the file 'src/debug.c'
* TPORT_LOG -- setting to 1 enables logging of SIP protocol messages.

See also Sofia-SIP documentation for environment variables to enable tracing
in various modules of the Sofia-SIP library:
